The Thornicroft's giraffe ("giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti"), also known as Thornicroft giraffe or Rhodesian giraffe, is a subspecies of giraffe. Thornicroft giraffes do not have any captive populations. Fewer than 1,500 remain in the wild. Rhodesian giraffes have star or leafy shaped spots that extend to their leg. These girrafes are restricted to eastern Zambia and the Luangwa Valley.The Luangwa national parks were declared game reserves because conservationist wanted to conserve the Thorncroft Giraffe,uniqui to the Luangwa valley of Zambia,Like all giraffes, Rhodesian giraffes share the same ancestors with deer and bovids.
The Arctic hare ("Lepus arcticus") is a social animal that lives in the frigid tundra of North America, Newfoundland, and Greenland. These hares often congregate in groups of up to 200 individuals. They hop at great speeds on their large, powerful hind legs, in a kangaroo-like fashion. The female is called a doe, the male is called a buck, and the baby hare is called a leveret. The young are born open-eyed and furry. Most hares live for about a year in the wild. 
This mammal is hunted by wolves and people. The young are preyed upon by Arctic foxes, falcons, snowy owls, and ermine (short-tailed weasels). They are unharmed during winter and are used to wintry weather.
The Fallow Deer (Dama dama) is a type of deer from the family Cervidae. The animal originally lived in Eurasia, but people have brought it to other parts of the world like Australia.
The male is called a "buck", the female is a "doe", and the young a "fawn". They live for about 12–16 years. All of the Fallow Deer have white spots on their backs, and black tips at the ends of their tails. Only bucks have antlers, which are wide and shaped like a shovel.
They are grazing animals. They like to live in an area that is mixed woodland and open grassland. They try to stay together in groups of up to 150.
They do have a lot of different coloured coats ("hair"). There are four main colours: "common", "menil", "melanistic" and "white". 
The Common coat is a brown coat with white spots that are best seen in the summer. In the winter the coat is much darker. The white coat is lightest colored, almost white. The common and menil coat are darker. The melanistic coat is very dark, sometimes even black.
One noted historical herd of fallow deer is located in the Ottenby Preserve in Öland, Sweden. Karl X Gustav built a drystone wall of four kilometres long around a royal fallow deer herd in the mid 17th century. The herd still exists as of 2006.
Another herd lives in Phoenix Park in Ireland. 400-450 fallow deer descend from the original herd introduced in the 1660s.
The Sparassodonts were an order of carnivorous Metatherian mammals. They are all now extinct.
The Sparassodonta is native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be a sister taxon to them. 
A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately in Eurasia. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia.
Members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental carnivora, but they were not closely related. They are a very good example of convergent evolution. 
For example, sparassodont molars were similar to the meat slicing teeth of modern cats. The canines were also lengthened, and in some cases, such as "Thylacosmilus", resemble those of saber-toothed cats like "Smilodon". Their body size varied, ranging from 80 cm (2 ft 8 in) long to the size of today's modern big cats.
Another family of large predators wrere the borhyaenids, which were more like wolves or dogs.

The forest dormice, genus Dryomys, are a genus of dormouse found throughout much of Eurasia. They are usually found in forests or thickets. 
The length of the head and body is , and the length of the tail is . The animals weigh .
These dormice hibernate in tree hollows or in burrows. At night they nest in low branches or shrubs. They spend most of their lives in trees. They are nocturnal animals. 
They are omnivorous feeding on seeds, acorns, buds, invertebrates, eggs, and baby birds. 
Forest dormice in southern areas breed from March to December. Forest dormice in northern areas breed from May to August. Gestation takes 21-30 days and 2-5 young are born at a time.
Macrauchenia was an early hoofed mammal with a long neck; it may have had a long trunk. This quadruped lived during the Pleistocene. Fossils of "Macrauchenia" have been found in Argentina, South America. "Macrauchenia" was an herbivore that had high-crowned cheek teeth.
Hydromys chrysogaster, also known as Rakali or Water-rat, is an Australian native rodent. The species lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries. It feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali are in length with a thick tail measuring around . They weigh . They have webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip.
Until the 1980s, this species was commonly known as Water-rat. During the 1990s there was a push for English common names to be replaced with indigenous names. In 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency recommended that the name Rakali be used as the common name. The Australian Department of Environment and Heritage has taken up this suggestion and both common names are now used.
The Giant Armadillo ("Priodontes maximus"), colloquially Tatou, Ocarro, Tatu-canastra or Tatú Carreta, is the largest living species of armadillo. It was once found widely throughout the tropical forests of eastern South America and now ranges throughout varied habitat as far south as northern Argentina.
The hazel dormouse or common dormouse is "Muscardinus avellanarius". This small rodent is the only living species in its genus.
It is long with a tail of . It weighs , increasing to just before hibernation. The hazel dormouse hibernates from October to April/May. In British sources, it is normally called the dormouse rather than the hazel or common dormouse.
The hazel dormouse is native to northern Europe and Asia Minor. It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, although the edible dormouse ("Glis glis") was accidentally introduced to the British Isles and now has an established population). 
The locations in the UK where the hazel dormouse can be found is shown on the National Biodivestity Network website.
The hazel dormouse is a European Protected Species and is protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
The hazel dormouse is the only small mammal in Britain to have a completely furry tail. It has golden-brown fur and large black eyes. It is a nocturnal creature and spends most of its waking hours looking for food in trees. It will make long trips in tree branches instead of coming down to the ground. This is to avoid danger.
In winter (early October), the hazel dormouse will hibernate in nests beneath the leaf litter on the forest floor. When it wakes up in spring (late April or early May), it builds nests out of honeysuckle bark, fresh leaves and grasses. If the weather is cold and wet and there is not much food, it saves energy by going into torpor (a temporary hibernation). It curls up into a ball and goes to sleep. The hazel dormouse spend a large amount of its life sleeping, either hibernating in winter or in torpor in summer.
Examination of hazelnuts may show a neat round hole in the shell. This shows that it has been opened by a small rodent like the dormouse, wood mouse, or bank vole. Other animals including squirrels or jays will either split the shell completely in half or make a jagged hole in it.
If you look closer at the hole, the inner rim of the hole will have toothmarks which are at an angle to the hole (if it has been made by a dormouse). The toothmarks are parallel with rough marks on the nut surface if a wood mouse made the hole. The bank vole leaves parallel grooves with no rough marks.
It feeds on a different foods which it can find in trees:
The hazel dormouse needs different food sources at different times of year to survive.
