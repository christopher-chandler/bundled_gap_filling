# Bundled Gap Filling: A New Paradigm for Unambiguous Cloze Exercises

# Abstract 

# 1. Introduction 
- [ ] cloze tests 
  - Cloze-tests (or gap-ﬁll tasks) (Taylor, 1953) are a frequently used exercise type, where a target word in a sentence is hidden and replaced with a gap.
- [ ] gap-ﬁll tasks
  - The ambiguity can be countered by providing a set of answer candidates for the learner to choose from.
    - single correct solution 
    - a set of incorrect distractors 
      - If they are too disimilar to the task at hand, the the task is too easy
